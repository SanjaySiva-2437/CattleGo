## Overview

CattleGo is a deep learning pipeline for **fine-grained visual classification of Indian cattle breeds** from camera or uploaded images. The system is designed to run efficiently on mobile hardware, enabling farmers, livestock researchers, and agri-tech platforms to identify breeds instantly — without domain expertise.

The model tackles a genuinely hard computer vision problem: distinguishing between **40+ morphologically similar cattle breeds** under uncontrolled real-world conditions (variable lighting, pose, background clutter).

---

## Problem

Manual breed identification requires trained veterinary experts and is impractical at scale. Existing generic image classifiers fail on fine-grained livestock classification due to:

- High inter-class visual similarity across breeds
- Intra-class variation from lighting, angle, and posture
- Limited labeled datasets for Indian indigenous breeds
- Compute constraints for mobile/edge deployment

---

## Solution

A **4-stage progressive fine-tuning pipeline** built on MobileNetV2, designed to maximize generalization on a constrained dataset while remaining deployable on mobile devices.

---

## Model Architecture

| Component         | Detail                             |
|-------------------|------------------------------------|
| Base Model        | MobileNetV2 (ImageNet pretrained)  |
| Framework         | TensorFlow / Keras                 |
| Input Shape       | 256 × 256 × 3                      |
| Output            | Softmax — multi-class (40+ breeds) |
| Deployment Target | Mobile (iOS / Android)             |
| Quantization      | FP16 / INT8 supported              |

MobileNetV2 was chosen for its **inverted residual structure with linear bottlenecks**, which delivers strong accuracy-to-latency tradeoffs critical for on-device inference.

---

## Training Strategy

Training used **progressive layer unfreezing** across 4 fine-tuning stages — a principled approach to transfer learning that prevents catastrophic forgetting while allowing deep feature adaptation.

```
Stage 1 → Train classification head only       (base frozen)
Stage 2 → Unfreeze top MobileNetV2 blocks      (lower LR)
Stage 3 → Unfreeze deeper layers               (lower LR + augmentation)
Stage 4 → Full network fine-tune               (minimal LR, early stopping)
```

## Training Evolution

### Stages 1 & 2 — Head Training → Initial Unfreezing

## Results

| Metric                       | Value              |
|------------------------------|--------------------|
| Baseline Validation Accuracy | ~53%               |
| Random Chance Baseline       | ~2.5%              |
| Number of Classes            | 40+ breeds         |
| Inference Target             | Mobile (real-time) |

**Context on accuracy:** Fine-grained classification across 40+ visually similar classes with a moderately sized dataset is a known hard problem. A random baseline sits at ~2.5%. The confusion matrix below reveals the model performs strongly on well-represented breeds, with most errors occurring between closely related regional variants — a sensible failure mode.

  <sub>Diagonal dominance indicates correct predictions. Off-diagonal clusters highlight visually similar breed pairs that warrant additional training data.</sub>

## Data Pipeline

### Preprocessing
- Resize to 256 × 256
- Per-channel pixel normalization
- Stratified train / validation split

### Augmentation
Augmentation was critical for improving robustness across natural variation in real-world cattle photography:
- Random rotation
- Horizontal flip
- Zoom transforms
- Brightness jitter
